# README for Food Tracker

### James Edwards

#### Overview

This sample application allows you to create meals with photos, ratings, and titles. These meals can be saved, and the user may edit or delete existing meals. This app is based off of the Swift tutorial provided by Apple [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html).

It was my first exposure to Swift, so I mostly stuck to the specific instructions of the tutorial.
